Ave!
Heard of Caesar cipher?
It's a simple shift cipher. Just choose the rotation key, and every letter will be cyclically sifted of it's value.

I can encrypt and decrypt text for you. Also I can try to break the cipher.

*Example:*
Key: 23
Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

*Available commands:*
/encrypt <text> # <key>
/decrypt <text> # <key>
/break <encrypted-text>

Note that you should use "#" character as the parameters delimiter.
